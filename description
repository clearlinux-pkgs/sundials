SUNDIALS is a family of software packages implemented with the goal of providing
robust time integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated
into existing simulation codes. The primary design goals are to require minimal
information from the user, allow users to easily supply their own data structures
underneath the packages, and allow for easy incorporation of user-supplied linear
solvers and preconditioners.
